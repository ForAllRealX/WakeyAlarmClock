# WakeyAlarmClock
Have trouble staying up after your alarm wakes you? Then look no further than here! You're guaranteed to stay awake as you must complete several challenging math problems in order to turn it off. By the time you're done, you're bound to be up and moving.

The Wakey Alarm Clock is a personal project inspired by the alarm clock I use on my phone to wake up every day. This project is intended for my own learning purposes, and likely will never have any real world use. However, that does not mean I'm not putting my best foot forward creating this, in fact quite the opposite; I am attempting to utilize all best practices and knowledge I've learned over time. 

This will always be an amusing little app to run, and it is fascinating seeing the culmination of my programming knowledge start coming together.

## Alarm Clock Goals & Scope Of Work
The main features I have determined to want in this alarm clock is as follows:
* Generate random math problems that are mixtures of addition and subtraction of 3 numbers.
  - More specifically, the final answer must be between a reasonable range of about 1 ≤ Answer ≤ 60 (arbitrary requirement).
  - Come up with a way to generate problems that is not ugly.
* The alarm keeps playing until the user successfully answers a set number of questions.
* Handle user input reasonably well.
* It is a personal goal of mine to not use unperformant ways to do things. I understand an app this small and insignificant would never need optimization and top speed, but

## Learning Goals, Takeaways, and Outcomes: 
* Basic QT Framework know-how: e.g. Signals and Slots Pattern, intermixing code with the .ui file(s), etc.
* Getting familiar with Git and GitHub: Understanding common commands on Git Bash, Branching, learning minute differences such as when to use Revert versus Reset, and the like.
* Debugging fundamentals and practice.
